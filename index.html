            <h2>1989 Chevy Lumina</h2>
            <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by Hunter, April 12th, 2017.</h5>

              The North American Chevrolet Lumina was based on the mid-size GM W-body, which was shared with the Pontiac Grand Prix, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme (later Intrigue), Buick Regal and Buick Century (after 1996). Although the Lumina became a popular seller, GM was widely criticized in the motoring press for being late to the game in introducing a direct aero-designed competitor to the Ford Taurus. Ironically, the "Lumina" name was considered by Ford in the pre-production stage of the Taurus. The Chevrolet Lumina's first generation ended production in August 1994, making this the shortest-lived generation of the first-generation GM W-body cars.
              In 1989, the Lumina became the nameplate under which Chevrolets were raced in NASCAR, more than a year before the model was available to the public.
              Chevrolet signed a deal with Disney-MGM Studios to make the 1990 Lumina the company's Official Car.

            <h2>2004 Chrylser Sebring (Convertible)</h2>
            <h5><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-time"></span> Post by Hunter, April 11th, 2017.</h5>

              The Sebring convertible was launched in 1996 alongside the Sebring coupe, replacing the LeBaron convertible. The convertible didn't share any sheetmetal with the coupe and was instead based on the Chrysler Cirrus sedan. Consequently, both the Cirrus and Sebring convertible were sold in Europe as the Stratus. All Stratus convertibles were sourced from Mexico. The Chrysler Stratus convertible was actually available in Mexico, but the sedan version was not. The Sebring convertible was sold alongside with the Chrysler Stratus convertible in Mexico. In Mexico, a rare turbocharged 2.4 L DOHC I4 engine was optional.

              The Sebring name was then used on three different cars for 2001: the coupe was based on the Mitsubishi Eclipse, while the sedan and convertible were Chrysler JR platform successors to the Chrysler Cirrus. The 2004 Chrysler Sebring had received minor tweaks to its front-end: a redesigned grille, re-worked headlights, and a Chrysler winged emblem placed in the center on the rear deck; furthermore, after the 2004 Chrysler Sebring sedan had seen a mild cycle refresh, the company discontinued the Chrysler Sebring coupe after model year 2005. And outside of the United States, and Canada, over into Mexico, the Sebring was sold as the Chrysler Cirrus. Exclusive for the Cirrus was the availability of Chrysler's turbocharged 2.4 L DOHC engine. The Cirrus available as a sedan, and convertible body-styles. Models with this engine are identified with a "High Output" badge on the back of the vehicle. Also unique to the Cirrus was the number of trim levels; the sedan was offered in two while the convertible was only offered in one. All were equipped with an automatic transmission.
